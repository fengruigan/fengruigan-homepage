                    This full-stack project was inspired by the 2020 CiGA Game
                    Jam in which I participated.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    I had a wonderful experience during the Game Jam event and I
                    wanted to celebrate my achievement of developing a game in 2
                    day. When I was writing down my experience during the event,
                    it occurred to me that it could be very interesting and
                    inspiring to hear development stories from other
                    participants. Therefore, I decided to build this project to
                    collect and show those development stories.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    This was my first "production" level project with real
                    users, and there were quite a few challenges. Because the
                    event has already ended, in order to effectively collect any
                    dev story, I had to develop the project as quickly as
                    possible. Even though I was the only person on the project,
                    I was able to produce a minimum viable product in 3 weeks.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Due to my lack of technical skills, the tech stack I chose
                    made it rather difficult to iterate the project in a fast
                    pace. In the end the project failed to gain traction.
                    Through this project inspired me to explore a lot more
                    technologies that allows to rapid pace development, such as
                    React and cloud solutions.

                    I had just decided to transition into Computer Science
                    industry and I was trying my best to explore the
                    posibilities. Being an avid gamer myself, I have seen a lot
                    of "Game Jam" games before, such as ones from Ludum Dare.
                    Hence, it was extra exciting that I was able to be a part of
                    what I liked. I had an extrodinary experience cooperating
                    with completely random strangers and feeling the adrendeline
                    rush of pushing for a deadline.

                    This was my very first toy "website" that I wrote when I was
                    just getting into web dev, and it was also my way of saying
                    goodbye to my physics career.

                    I always hoped more people can like and learn about physics,
                    so I tried to create a site that can potentially help
                    explain/visualize some of the non-intuitive physics
                    phenomena.

                    The page was built with very "primative" techs. Because this
                    page was meant to be a toy project, it was not that good,
                    and you can probably see that I was trying weird things
                    (that do not go well together).
