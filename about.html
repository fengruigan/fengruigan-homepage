          <h2>As a physicist</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I worked with Dr. David Patterson at UCSB. In the lab, I primarily worked on the Molecular Spectroscopy
            experiment and focused on a few tools for the experiment, including a 24/7 temperature collecting and
            plotting script and a high frequency microwave circuit box that can both drive and listen for microwave
            signals. The lab website can be found
            <a href="https://pattersongroup.physics.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

            While I was not a very talented physicist, I do like physics a lot. I am a very curious person and I always
            wondered how things work. From physics, I can learn why things work the way they do from the very
            foundation, which was very enticing to me. Physics may seem very daunting to many other people, and I wanted
            to change this impression by helping them realize that physics is fun. So
            <a href="https://physics-playground.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >my very first website</a
            >
            was an attempt to help people (especially students) play around with physics concepts that may be
            unintuitive.

          <h2>As an SDE</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I had some experience with building small tools for the physics lab. Those experience taught me important
            skills to learn on my own and persist through obstacles, but more importantly, I found that I really love
            the problem solving process of designing, building, and iterate. That was when I started to explore computer
            science and started my Master's degree at Northeastern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lucky enough to start my career as an SDE intern at Amazon, where I learned quite literally
            everything. I started from not knowing what Gradle is to successfully building a full-stack website with
            fully serverless architecture using AWS.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where I am at, and I really look forward to exploring a lot of of computer science, and seeing where
            my future holds.
