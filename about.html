          <hr />
          <p>
            I worked with Dr. David Patterson at UCSB. In the lab, I primarily
            worked on the Molecular Spectroscopy experiment and focused on a few
            tools for the experiment, including a 24/7 temperature collecting
            and plotting script and a high frequency microwave circuit box that
            can both drive and listen for microwave signals. The lab website can
            be found

            While I was not a very talented physicist, I do like physics a lot.
            I am a very curious person and I always wondered how things work.
            From physics, I can learn why things work the way they do from the
            very foundation, which was very enticing to me. Physics may seem
            very daunting to many other people, and I wanted to change this
            impression by helping them realize that physics is fun. So

              >my very first website</a
            >
            was an attempt to help people (especially students) play around with
            physics concepts that may be unintuitive.

          <h2>As an SDE</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I had some experience with building small tools for the physics lab.
            Those experience taught me important skills to learn on my own and
            persist through obstacles, but more importantly, I found that I
            really love the problem solving process of designing, building, and
            iterate. That was when I started to explore computer science and
            started my Master's degree at Northeastern University.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was lucky enough to start my career as an SDE intenr at Amazon,
            where I learned quite literally everything. I started from not
            knowing what Gradle is to successfully building a full-stack website
            with fully serverless architecture using AWS.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where I am at, and I really look forward to exploring a lot
            of of computer science, and seeing where my future holds.
